I attest that the work that I have submitted for this assignment was either a) provided to me by the instructor (the skeleton code) or b) written completely on my own as an original piece of work
for this course.
- https://github.com/fangyidong/json-simple <= The JSONSimple library use to parse the JSON files.

How to run the program:

- Ensure that you have a correctly formatted "fileLocations.json" file available, and that two more JSON files with names specified in the "fileLocations" file also exist.
- In the main folder, type:\n
  java -jar build/libs/A1.jar
- This will show the rooms as defined in the "Rooms" file, with each room numbered by the id tag.
- The adventurers name will be "Bilbo Baggins" to start, and this cannot be changed yet.
